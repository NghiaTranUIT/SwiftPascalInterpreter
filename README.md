# Pascal interpreter written in Swift
One day hopefully a simple Swift interpreter for the Pascal language inspired by the [Letâ€™s Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) article series.

## Implemented so far

Lexer, parser and interpreter for the following grammar

````    
program : compound_statement DOT
     
compound_statement : BEGIN statement_list END
     
statement_list : statement
| statement SEMI statement_list
     
statement : compound_statement
| assignment_statement
| empty
     
assignment_statement : variable ASSIGN expr
     
empty :
     
expr: term ((PLUS | MINUS) term)*
     
term: factor ((MUL | DIV) factor)*
     
factor : PLUS factor
| MINUS factor
| INTEGER
| LPAREN expr RPAREN
| variable
     
variable: ID     
````

## Try it out

There is a Swift playground in the project where you can try out the lexer, parser and the interpreter. The lexer shows the tokens recognized, the parses prints the abstract syntax tree of the program and interpreter prints the resulting memory state.
